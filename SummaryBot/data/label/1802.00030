. The present work shows the application of transfer learning for
a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN), using a small image dataset (≈
12,000) on a single workstation with enabled NVIDIA GPU card that takes
up to 1 hour to complete the training task and archive an overall average
accuracy of 94.7%. The DNN presents a 20% score of misclassiﬁcation for an
external test dataset. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is equivalent
to ones using HSI methodology (81%-91%) used for the same task, but with the
advantage of being independent on special equipment to classify wheat kernel
for FHB symptoms.
