. We introduce a new metric for measuring how well a model personalizes to a
user’s speciﬁc preferences. We deﬁne personalization as a weighting between performance
on user speciﬁc data and performance on a more general global dataset that represents
many diﬀerent users. This global term serves as a form of regularization that forces us
to not overﬁt to individual users who have small amounts of data. In order to protect
user privacy, we add the constraint that we may not centralize or share user data. We
also contribute a simple experiment in which we simulate classifying sentiment for users
with very distinct vocabularies. This experiment functions as an example of the tension
between doing well globally on all users, and doing well on any speciﬁc individual user. It
also provides a concrete example of how to employ our new metric to help reason about
and resolve this tension. We hope this work can help frame and ground future work into
personalization.
