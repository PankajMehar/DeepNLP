—Methods exploiting sparsity have been popular in
imaging and signal processing applications including compres-
sion, denoising, and imaging inverse problems. Data-driven
approaches such as dictionary learning enable one to discover
complex image features from datasets and provide promising
performance over analytical models. Alternating minimization
algorithms have been particularly popular in dictionary and
transform learning. In this work, we study the properties of
alternating minimization for structured (unitary) sparsifying op-
erator learning. While the algorithm converges to the stationary
points of the non-convex problem in general, we prove local
linear convergence to the underlying generative model under mild
assumptions. Our experiments show that the unitary operator
learning algorithm is robust to initialization.
