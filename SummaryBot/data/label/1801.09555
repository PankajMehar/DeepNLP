In this work, we present a fully automated lung computed
tomography (CT) cancer diagnosis system, DeepLung.
DeepLung consists of two components, nodule detection
(identifying the locations of candidate nodules) and clas-
siﬁcation (classifying candidate nodules into benign or ma-
lignant). Considering the 3D nature of lung CT data and
the compactness of dual path networks (DPN), two deep
3D DPN are designed for nodule detection and classiﬁca-
tion respectively. Speciﬁcally, a 3D Faster Regions with
Convolutional Neural Net (R-CNN) is designed for nod-
ule detection with 3D dual path blocks and a U-net-like
encoder-decoder structure to effectively learn nodule fea-
tures. For nodule classiﬁcation, gradient boosting machine
(GBM) with 3D dual path network features is proposed.
The nodule classiﬁcation subnetwork was validated on a
public dataset from LIDC-IDRI, on which it achieved bet-
ter performance than state-of-the-art approaches and sur-
passed the performance of experienced doctors based on
image modality. Within the DeepLung system, candidate
nodules are detected ﬁrst by the nodule detection subnet-
work, and nodule diagnosis is conducted by the classiﬁ-
cation subnetwork. Extensive experimental results demon-
strate that DeepLung has performance comparable to expe-
rienced doctors both for the nodule-level and patient-level
diagnosis on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.1
