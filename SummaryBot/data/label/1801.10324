 Texture is a fundamental characteristic of many types
of images, and texture representation is one of the essential and
challenging problems in computer vision and pattern recognition
which has attracted extensive research attention. Since 2000, tex-
ture representations based on Bag of Words (BoW) and on Con-
volutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been extensively stud-
ied with impressive performance. Given this period of remarkable
evolution, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of
advances in texture representation over the last two decades. More
than 200 major publications are cited in this survey covering dif-
ferent aspects of the research, which includes (i) problem descrip-
tion; (ii) recent advances in the broad categories of BoW-based,
CNN-based and attribute-based methods; and (iii) evaluation is-
sues, speciﬁcally benchmark datasets and state of the art results. In
retrospect of what has been achieved so far, the survey discusses
open challenges and directions for future research.
