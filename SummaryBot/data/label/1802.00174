The linear model uses the space deﬁned by the input to project
the target or desired signal and ﬁnd the optimal set of model
parameters. When the problem is nonlinear, the adaption re-
quires nonlinear models for good performance, but it becomes
slower and more cumbersome. In this paper, we propose a lin-
ear model called Augmented Space Linear Model (ASLM),
which uses the full joint space of input and desired signal as
the projection space and approaches the performance of non-
linear models. This new algorithm takes advantage of the lin-
ear solution, and corrects the estimate for the current testing
phase input with the error assigned to the input space neigh-
borhood in the training phase. This algorithm can solve the
nonlinear problem with the computational efﬁciency of lin-
ear methods, which can be regarded as a trade off between
accuracy and computational complexity. Making full use of
the training data, the proposed augmented space model may
provide a new way to improve many modeling tasks.
