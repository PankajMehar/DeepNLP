Accurate, reliable sampling from fully-connected
graphs with arbitrary correlations is a diﬃcult prob-
lem. Such sampling requires knowledge of the prob-
abilities of observing every possible state of a graph.
As graph size grows, the number of model states be-
comes intractably large and eﬃcient computation re-
quires full sampling be replaced with heuristics and
algorithms that are only approximations of full sam-
pling. This work investigates the potential impact
of adiabatic quantum computation for sampling pur-
poses, building on recent successes training Boltz-
mann machines using a quantum device. We inves-
tigate the use case of quantum computation to train
Boltzmann machines for predicting the 2016 Presi-
dential election.
