—Non-recurring trafﬁc congestion is caused by tem-
porary disruptions, such as accidents, sports games, adverse
weather, etc. We use data related to real-time trafﬁc speed,
jam factors (a trafﬁc congestion indicator), and events collected
over a year from Nashville, TN to train a multi-layered deep
neural network. The trafﬁc dataset contains over 900 million
data records. The network is thereafter used to classify the real-
time data and identify anomalous operations. Compared with
traditional approaches of using statistical or machine learning
techniques, our model reaches an accuracy of 98.73 percent
when identifying trafﬁc congestion caused by football games. Our
approach ﬁrst encodes the trafﬁc across a region as a scaled
image. After that the image data from different timestamps
is fused with event- and time-related data. Then a crossover
operator is used as a data augmentation method to generate
training datasets with more balanced classes. Finally, we use
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to tune the
sensitivity of the classiﬁer. We present the analysis of the training
time and the inference time separately.
