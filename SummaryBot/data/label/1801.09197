We algorithmically construct multi-output Gaus-
sian process priors which satisfy linear differential
equations. Our approach attempts to parametrize
all solutions of the equations using Gr¨obner bases.
If successful, a push forward Gaussian process
along the paramerization is the desired prior. We
consider several examples, among them the full
inhomogeneous system of Maxwell’s equations.
By bringing together stochastic learning and com-
puteralgebra in a novel way, we combine noisy
observations with precise algebraic computations.
