We consider the matrix completion problem with a deterministic pattern of observed
entries and aim to ﬁnd conditions such that there will be (at least locally) unique
solution to the non-convex Minimum Rank Matrix Completion (MRMC) formulation.
We answer the question from a somewhat diﬀerent point of view and to give a geometric
perspective. We give a suﬃcient and “almost necessary” condition (which we call the
well-posedness condition) for the local uniqueness of MRMC solutions and illustrate
with some special cases where such condition can be veriﬁed. We also consider the
convex relaxation and nuclear norm minimization formulations. Then we argue that the
low-rank approximation approaches are more stable than MRMC and further propose
a sequential statistical testing procedure to determine the rank of the matrix from
observed entries. Finally, numerical examples veriﬁed the validity of our theory.
