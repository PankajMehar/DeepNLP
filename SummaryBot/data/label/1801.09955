Clustering is inherently ill-posed: there often ex-
ist multiple valid clusterings of a single dataset,
and without any additional information a cluster-
ing system has no way of knowing which clus-
tering it should produce. This motivates the use
of constraints in clustering, as they allow users to
communicate their interests to the clustering sys-
tem. Active constraint-based clustering algorithms
select the most useful constraints to query, aim-
ing to produce a good clustering using as few con-
straints as possible. We propose COBRA, an active
method that Ô¨Årst over-clusters the data by running
K-means with a K that is intended to be too large,
and subsequently merges the resulting small clus-
ters into larger ones based on pairwise constraints.
In its merging step, COBRA is able to keep the
number of pairwise queries low by maximally ex-
ploiting constraint transitivity and entailment. We
experimentally show that COBRA outperforms the
state of the art in terms of clustering quality and
runtime, without requiring the number of clusters
in advance.
