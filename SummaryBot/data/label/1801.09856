—The artificial neural network shows powerful ability 
of inference, but it is still criticized for lack of interpretability and 
prerequisite  needs  of  big  dataset.  This  paper  proposes  the  Rule-
embedded  Neural  Network  (ReNN)  to  overcome  the  shortages. 
ReNN first  makes local-based inferences to detect local patterns, 
and  then  uses  rules  based  on  domain  knowledge  about  the  local 
patterns to generate rule-modulated map. After that, ReNN makes 
global-based inferences that synthesizes the local patterns and the 
rule-modulated map. To solve the optimization problem caused by 
rules, we use a two-stage optimization strategy to train the ReNN 
model.  By  introducing  rules  into  ReNN,  we  can  strengthen 
traditional  neural  networks  with  long-term  dependencies  which 
are  difficult  to  learn  with  limited  empirical  dataset,  thus 
improving inference accuracy. The complexity of neural networks 
can be reduced since long-term dependencies are not modeled with 
neural  connections,  and  thus  the  amount  of  data  needed  to 
optimize the neural networks can be reduced. Besides, inferences 
from  ReNN  can  be  analyzed  with  both  local  patterns  and  rules, 
and thus have better interpretability. In this paper, ReNN has been 
validated with a time-series detection problem.
