Accurate and transparent prediction of cancer survival times on the level of indi-
vidual patients can inform and improve patient care and treatment practices. In
this paper, we design a model that concurrently learns to accurately predict patient-
speciﬁc survival distributions and to explain its predictions in terms of patient
attributes such as clinical tests or assessments. Our model is ﬂexible and based
on a recurrent network, can handle various modalities of data including temporal
measurements, and yet constructs and uses simple explanations in the form of
patient- and time-speciﬁc linear regression. For analysis, we use two publicly
available datasets and show that our networks outperform a number of baselines in
prediction while providing a way to inspect the reasons behind each prediction.
