—In this paper, we propose a novel approach, 3D-RecGAN++, which reconstructs the complete 3D structure of a given object
from a single arbitrary depth view using generative adversarial networks. Unlike existing work which typically requires multiple views of
the same object or class labels to recover the full 3D geometry, the proposed 3D-RecGAN++ only takes the voxel grid representation of a
depth view of the object as input, and is able to generate the complete 3D occupancy grid with a high resolution of 2563 by recovering
the occluded/missing regions. The key idea is to combine the generative capabilities of autoencoders and the conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework, to infer accurate and ﬁne-grained 3D structures of objects in high-dimensional voxel space.
Extensive experiments on large synthetic datasets and real-world Kinect datasets show that the proposed 3D-RecGAN++ signiﬁcantly
outperforms the state of the art in single view 3D object reconstruction, and is able to reconstruct unseen types of objects.
