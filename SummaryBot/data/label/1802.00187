â€”Clustering is essential to many tasks in pattern
recognition and computer vision. With the advent of deep learn-
ing, there is an increasing interest in learning deep unsupervised
representations for clustering analysis. Many works on this
domain rely on variants of auto-encoders and use the encoder out-
puts as representations/features for clustering. In this paper, we
show that an l2 normalization constraint on these representations
during auto-encoder training, makes the representations more
separable and compact in the Euclidean space after training.
This greatly improves the clustering accuracy when k-means
clustering is employed on the representations. We also propose a
clustering based unsupervised anomaly detection method using
l2 normalized deep auto-encoder representations. We show the
effect of l2 normalization on anomaly detection accuracy. We
further show that
the proposed anomaly detection method
greatly improves accuracy compared to previously proposed deep
methods such as reconstruction error based anomaly detection.
