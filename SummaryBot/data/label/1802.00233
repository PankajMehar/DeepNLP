. A decision tree T in Bm := {0, 1}m is a binary tree where
each of its internal nodes is labeled with an integer in [m] = {1, 2, . . . , m},
each leaf is labeled with an assignment a ∈ Bm and each internal node
has two outgoing edges that are labeled with 0 and 1, respectively. Let
A ⊂ {0, 1}m. We say that T is a decision tree for A if (1) For every a ∈ A
there is one leaf of T that is labeled with a. (2) For every path from the
root to a leaf with internal nodes labeled with i1, i2, . . . , ik ∈ [m], a leaf
labeled with a ∈ A and edges labeled with ξi1 , . . . , ξik ∈ {0, 1}, a is the
only element in A that satisﬁes aij = ξij for all j = 1, . . . , k.
Our goal is to write a polynomial time (in n := |A| and m) algorithm
that for an input A ⊆ Bm outputs a decision tree for A of minimum
depth. This problem has many applications that include, to name a few,
computer vision, group testing, exact learning from membership queries
and game theory.
Arkin et al. and Moshkov [4,14] gave a polynomial time (ln|A|)- approx-
imation algorithm (for the depth). The result of Dinur and Steurer [6] for
set cover implies that this problem cannot be approximated with ratio
(1− o(1))· ln|A|, unless P=NP. Moskov studied in [14] the combinatorial
measure of extended teaching dimension of A, ETD(A). He showed that
ETD(A) is a lower bound for the depth of the decision tree for A and
then gave an exponential time ETD(A)/ log(ETD(A))-approximation al-
gorithm.
In this paper we further study the ETD(A) measure and a new com-
binatorial measure, DEN(A), that we call the density of the set A. We
show that DEN(A) ≤ ETD(A) + 1. We then give two results. The ﬁrst
result is that the lower bound ETD(A) of Moshkov for the depth of the
decision tree for A is greater than the bounds that are obtained by the
classical technique used in the literature. The second result is a poly-
nomial time (ln 2)DEN(A)-approximation (and therefore (ln 2)ETD(A)-
approximation) algorithm for the depth of the decision tree of A. We
also show that a better approximation ratio implies P=NP.
We then apply the above results to learning the class of disjunctions
of predicates from membership queries [5]. We show that the ETD of
this class is bounded from above by the degree d of its Hasse diagram.
We then show that Moshkov algorithm can be run in polynomial time
and is (d/ log d)-approximation algorithm. This gives optimal algorithms
when the degree is constant. For example, learning axis parallel rays over
constant dimension space.
