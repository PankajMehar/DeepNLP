Systematic reviews are essential in various domains to
summarize evidence from multiple sources. They are used
in the formulation of public policies and also contribute in
medicine in the development of clinical guidance [6, 3]. They
involve the searching, screening and synthesis of research ev-
idence from multiple sources available in the form of textual
documents.
It is critical in systematic reviews to identify
all studies relevant to the review in order to minimise bias.
It is easy to see that such a process can be extremely time-
consuming and demand signiﬁcant human resources [12].
Researchers have exploited active learning text classiﬁca-
tion to make the process of systematic review more eﬃcient.
Active learning is an iterative process that starts from a
small set of labelled studies and gradually learns to diﬀer-
entiate between relevant and irrelevant studies [10, 15, 4].
Feature extraction models are essential to the success of
active learning.
[15] proposed a multi-view approach that
encoded documents in terms of diﬀerent feature vectors such
as, words that appear in the title and the abstract, keywords
and MeSH terms. Each feature space is used to train a dif-
ferent classiﬁer, and an ensemble of those classiﬁers predicts
the ﬁnal outcome based on majority voting.
Most previous approaches worked well for studies in the
clinical domain, but it was shown in [10] that the task of
identifying relevant studies in public health domain resulted
in poorer performance. It was argued that the task of iden-
tifying relevant studies is more challenging in this domain
compared to clinical domain due to the presence of doc-
uments from wide ranging disciplines (e.g., social science,
occupational health, education, etc.) in public health com-
pared to more speciﬁc studies included in clinical systematic
reviews [1]. The authors proposed using topic modelling to
extract topic based features using Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion [2]. In addition to LDA, there are a variety of diﬀerent
topic models available in machine learning like probabilistic
latent semantic indexing (pLSI).
Hashimoto et al. [7] presented a topic detection model to
improve the performance of the active learning classiﬁer. It
uses a neural network model, popularly referred to as para-
graph vectors [8] to extract ﬁxed length feature representa-
tions from the documents. It is argued that the paragraph
vectors can encode information contained in the sequence of
words. As opposed to topic modelling techniques like LDA
that treat documents as bag-of-words [9]. It was shown in
[8] that paragraph vectors can compute semantic relatedness
between diﬀerent textual contents of varying lengths. LDA
on the other hand treats documents as bag-of-words and
does not utilise the information stored in the sequence and
context of words. [7] models topics using clustered represen-
tation of paragraph vectors and represents each document
in terms of the normalized distance from cluster centroids.
In this work, we perform experiments on a comprehensive
dataset of reviews derived from wide ranging and diverse
domains. We perform experiments with diﬀerent feature ex-
traction techniques including bag-of-words, paragraph vec-
tors and topic modelling using LDA. We observe that dif-
ferent feature extraction methods work well for diﬀerent do-
mains, but no isolated feature extraction technique works
well for all reviews. In previous works [15, 7], a naive active
learning algorithm is used. A naive active learning algo-
rithm suﬀers from the problem of retrieving studies that are
similar to the previously retrieved studies. It happens be-
cause the active learning classiﬁer does not receive enough
diverse samples to classify correctly. In [13], authors propose
active learning with rationals, where, rationals are basically
groups of words (phrases) that describe the label. These ra-
tionals are asked from labeler while providing the label and
can lead to extra manual eﬀort.
In addition, such an ap-
proach can only work well with bag of words representation
of documents, and not with paragraph vector based repre-
sentation. In many cases, (including our case), we can not
get additional data for the labels because of extra manual
eﬀort involved.
[14] proposed an active learning strategy
that uses a non-linear SVM, but training such classiﬁers is
time consuming and not suited for active learning in clinical
text classiﬁcation, since the system can not keep the labeler
waiting for documents to labelled.
We propose a novel active learning algorithm for clinical
text classiﬁcation that reduces the bias by including novelty
in addition to the relevance of documents, and derive mean-
ingful insights from our results on how to choose a feature
extraction model for a particular review. Our contributions
can be summarized as follows:
• We perform experiments on the use of diﬀerent feature
extraction models over a comprehensive set of reviews,
and contrary to the published results in [7] observe on a
larger dataset that paragraph vector based topic mod-
elling does not work better compared to bag-of-words
and/or simple paragraph vectors based approach for
active learning in systematic reviews.
• We propose a novel active learning algorithm that re-
moves the inevitable bias in naive algorithms based
solely on relevance, and instead develop an algorithm
that in its early phases uses the novelty of documents,
in addition to their relevance.
• We derive insights from our experiments on the per-
formance of diﬀerent feature extraction models for dif-
ferent domains, and propose an eﬀective way to choose
the correct feature extraction model that requires no
prior knowledge of the domain and/or review.
2. METHODS
2.1 Feature Extraction
2.1.1 Bag-of-Words
The most basic and oldest of feature extraction models
from text documents is referred to as bag-of-words. In the
bag-of-words model, each of the possible terms in the entire
corpus of documents is used to construct a vocabulary. In
addition to simple bag-of-words, the terms may be weighted
by tf-idf, which measures the relative popularity of diﬀerent
words in a given document and reduces the popularity of
commonly used words in the corpus.
2.1.2 Latent Dirichlet Analysis
Topic modelling techniques, like LDA [2], have been used
in the area of systematic reviews to extract topical features
from studies [11]. Such topical representations extracted
from the documents are then used for training the active
learning classiﬁer.
2.1.3 Paragraph Vectors
Recently, a neural network model has been proposed that
learns word vectors and paragraph vectors (PV) in a joint
manner [8]. That is in contrast to the approach of learn-
ing them separately. Originally, word vectors represented
only the words, but paragraph vectors are able to represent
a sequence of words in the form of phrases, sentences or
paragraphs. Paragraph vectors have been reported to work
with success in some previous works [7], and are expected
to encode natural language better than other topic mod-
els. They have been used to measure similarities between
Wikipedia article and research papers [5]. They have also
been used to extract topics from studies used in systematic
reviews [7].
2.1.4 Topic Modelling using PV
In [7], a technique for topic modelling using paragraph vec-
tors was proposed. It is argued that paragraph vectors lead
to better feature extraction by jointly learning the vector
representation of words and documents. Hence, clustering
such paragraph vectors can lead to better topic modelling
compared to topic models that are based on bag-of-words
representation, like LDA [2].
2.1.5 Clustering Bag-of-Words
We can cluster the tf-idf based bag-of-words representa-
tion of documents to obtain topics. The documents can then
be represented in terms of the cluster-distance matrix. It is
the most basic of the diﬀerent topic extraction models that
was used as a baseline in [7].
2.2 Active Learning
The active learning process begins with a small number
of manually labelled documents. These documents are then
used to train a classiﬁer that can be used to diﬀerentiate
relevant and irrelevant studies among the rest of the stud-
ies. These studies are ordered in decreasing probability of
relevance and the top-k studies are manually reviewed by
an expert reviewer. These manually reviewed k studies are
then used to retrain the active learning classiﬁer along with
the previously labelled studies.
There is an obvious problem with such a naive active
learning algorithm. The classiﬁer can easily get biased to-
wards studies that are chosen in the beginning of the pro-
cess. Such a classiﬁer would continue to look for similar
studies based on its current knowledge. It would lead to a
biased sample of studies in the training set of the classiﬁer.
We hypothesized that including novelty in addition to rele-
vance while choosing documents for active learning can lead
to an overall improvement in performance. Some other ap-
proaches like [13] require additional information about the
labels, and can only work well with bag-of-words represen-
tation of documentation.
In comparison, our method can
work well with both bag-of-words and distributed represen-
tations (like paragraph vectors). Note, that to the best of
our knowledge, naive active learning is the only algorithm
used with success in systematic reviews [7, 12].
2.2.1 Proposed Algorithm
To solve the above mentioned problems, we extract topics
from documents using LDA topic model. It gives as output
topic vectors for each document in the corpus v(d) ∈ Rk×1.
These topic vectors from diﬀerent documents form a matrix
V ∈ Rn×k, where n is the number of studies in the cor-
pus and k is the number of topics. We create a separate
matrix of topic vectors for documents d that have already
been manually labelled. We refer to the set of already la-
belled documents as H, and the matrix of topic vectors for
documents d ∈ H is referred to as S ∈ R|H|×k. We denote
the set of currently unlabelled documents as G, and set of
all documents as D. We use principal component analysis
to compute the top-t principal eigen vectors of ST S. We
deﬁne the probability of a document being novel as:
p(n|d) = 1 − (cid:107)U U T v(d)(cid:107)2
(cid:107)v(d)(cid:107)2
(1)
where U ∈ Rk×t contains t principal eigen vectors, and
U U T ∈ Rk×k is the subspace formed by top-t principal eigen
vectors of ST S. It basically measures the novelty of a doc-
ument by projecting its topic vector on the principal sub-
space formed by topic vectors of documents in the training
set. The projection should be small for a document to be
considered novel and vice versa, if not novel. Additionally,
we obtain the probability of a given document d being rele-
vant p(r|d) from the classiﬁer. We compute the probability
of document being both relevant and novel as:
p(r, n|d) = p(r|d) ∗ p(n|d)
(2)
We order the documents by above mentioned p(r, n|d),
and then select the top-k documents in each iterative step
of the active learning algorithm for review by an expert re-
viewer. We continue using novelty of a document in the ac-
tive learning process till we have discovered a certain ﬁxed
number of topics. We assign a document d to topic i if
i = arg max
vk(d)
where vk(d) is the value in kth index of topic vector v(d).
Afterwards, we stop incorporating the novelty in the active
learning process and continue solely based on relevance. We
assume that a given topic has been discovered if any doc-
ument in the labelled set H is assigned to that topic. We
provide a more formal description of the above mentioned
process in Algorithm 1.
2.3 Evaluation
2.3.1 Evaluation Method
Firstly, we evaluate the performance of active learning
classiﬁer using diﬀerent feature extraction methods. We ex-
periment with both a linear-SVM (as used in [7, 10]) and a
logistic regression classiﬁer and observe that performance of
both classiﬁers is very similar. Therefore, we use a logistic
regression classiﬁer that models the posterior probability of
a study being eligible p(y|d).
Secondly, we evaluate our proposed active learning algo-
rithm and compare against the naive active learning ap-
proach. The active learning process starts with a small set of
manually labelled studies. Features are extracted from this
labelled set using diﬀerent feature extraction models men-
tioned above. At each step of the iterative process a ﬁxed set
of studies are reviewed manually by an expert reviewer. We
extract a sample of top-k studies at each iterative step for
manual labelling from the ordered list of candidate studies
[4, 12].
Thirdly, we derive insights from our experiments that would
help us choose the correct feature extraction model without
prior knowledge of the reviews.
All our datasets are already labelled by expert reviewers.
We simulated a human feedback active learning strategy [7,
10, 15]. Our evaluation strategy is similar to the previously
published work [7].
2.3.2 Parameter Tuning
We tune the diﬀerent parameters of PV using cross vali-
dation. We keep the number of topics in LDA at 300, as in
[7]. We experimented with dimensionality of paragraph vec-
tors and found that using 300 dimensional document vectors
performed better in general across diﬀerent reviews. We ex-
perimented with higher value of dimension such as 1000 (as

infer that no feature extraction method is obviously superior to others for all the documents/domains.

the best results. The number of principal eigen vectors that
we use to compute p(n|d) are 3, i.e. t = 3 (line 42 in Algo-
rithm 1). The value of parameter max topics was set to 150
in line 6 of Algorithm 1. It denotes the number of topics
to be explored before we stop using novelty as a criteria in
our active learning algorithm. We used the value of s = 25
in the algorithm. A small values for s implies that the clas-
siﬁer would have to be learned too often, and larger value
would lead to selecting too few relevant documents in the
beginning, and as a result decrease in overall performance.
2.3.3 Evaluation Metric
We evaluate the performance of our active learning process
using a metric called WSS@95. It stands for Work Saved
over Sampling at 95% yield. It can be expressed as:
W SS@95 = (1 − burden) | yield ≥ 95%
yield =
T P M + T P A
T P M + T P A + F N A
burden =
T P M + T N M + T P A + F P A

where N are the # of studies and superscript M and A de-
note manual and automatic screening decisions. TP, FP,
TN and FN stand for # of True Positives, False Positives,
True Negatives and False Negatives respectively. These no-
tations/deﬁnitions are similar to those mentioned in [7].
2.4 Datasets
We used a number of public health, animal study and
clinical review datasets from completed systematic reviews.
Some of these datasets have been previously used in Miwa
et al.
[7]. We summarize the
characteristics of diﬀerent datasets used in our experiments
in Table 1. We give a short description of diﬀerent datasets
used:
[10] and Hashimoto et al.
• LHVS: Leukodepletion for patients undergoing heart
valve surgery
• ASCD: Amiodarone versus other pharmacological in-
terventions for prevention of sudden cardiac death
• FABC: Altering availability and proximity of products
for changing selection and consumption of food, alco-
hol and tobacco
• NPA: Animal studies on neuropathic pain
• CAFO: Concentrated animal feeding operations
• DPCAD: Psychological and pharmacological interven-
tions for depression in patients with coronary artery
disease
• STCS: Preoperative statin therapy for patients under-
going cardiac surgery
• FVC: Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable
consumption in children aged 5 years and under
• SPCHD: Internet-based interventions for the secondary
prevention of coronary heart disease
• Youth Development, Cooking Skills and Plain Tobacco
Packaging as described in [7, 10]
3. RESULTS
We investigate the performance of diﬀerent feature extrac-
tion techniques in terms of relevant studies discovered and
amount of manual annotations required. We plot the num-
ber of relevant studies identiﬁed for a given amount of man-
ual annotation for diﬀerent reviews that range from public
health to clinical science. Both these quantities converge
to their maximum value during the last iteration of the ac-
tive learning process. We plot the performance for diﬀer-
ent feature extraction models in Figure 1. We denote topic
modelling based on paragraph vectors with PV-TM, BoW
stands for bag-of-words, BoW-TM denotes topic modelling
based on BoW model and LDA refers to Latent Dirichlet
Allocation. We can see in Figure 1 that diﬀerent feature
extraction methods work well for diﬀerent studies. We ob-
serve that in majority of the cases, paragraph vectors and
BoW models perform better than the rest.
In documents
pertaining to public health, BoW performs well, whereas for
clinical reviews PV performs well. These results are con-
trary to previous results in [7], where the topic modelling
based on PVs seemed to outperform other models across all
disciplines. We observe that BoW and PV perform better
than topic modelling based on paragraph vectors on most
datasets. We show that it is not possible to ﬁnd a single
feature extraction method that performs superior to others
across all domains, but we need to identify one per each
review.
When we use our active learning algorithm with BoW
model, then we refer to it as IG-BOW (Information Gain-
BOW), whereas when we use the paragraph vector model,
we refer to it as IG-PV (Information Gain-PV). We can
observe the performance of proposed active learning algo-
rithm compared to the naive active learning algorithm as the
screening progresses in Figure 2. We can notice that our pro-
posed algorithm explores in the initial phases of the screen-
ing process, but as the process continues the performance
improves. It outperforms naive active learning algorithm by
the end of the screening process. We plot the WSS@95 (i.e.
WSS at 95% yield) in Figure 3 for our proposed active learn-
ing algorithm. In addition to the naive active learning algo-
rithm, we compare our method with an additional baseline
algorithm that selects the samples about which the classiﬁer
is least conﬁdent during the initial 10% (set using cross val-
idation on independent dataset) screening i.e.
it randomly

Figure 2: X-axis represents the number of documents that have been manually annotated and Y-axis represents the number
of relevant documents that have been discovered. We can observe that our proposed active learning algorithm, that is IG-PV
and IG-BOW explore during the initial phases of screening and then their performance improves as the process continues. We
show the results of proposed active learning algorithm compared to the naive active learning algorithm in terms of WSS@95
in Figure 3.
selects k studies that have 0.4 ≤ p(y = 1|d) ≤ 0.6. We re-
fer to this baseline as LC, and consequently, LC-BoW uses
bag-of-words as features and LC-PV uses paragraph vectors
as features. We can observe that one of the two, i.e. IG-
BoW or IG-PV, performs better compared to naive active
learning algorithm using just BoW or PV. It validates our
hypothesis that using novelty to explore during the initial
phases of active learning can lead to better results overall,
especially in terms of WSS@95. We only present BoW and
PV because (as we mentioned in the previous paragraph)
we observed that these two feature extraction methods per-
form well across most studies. We should mention at this
point that we also used our active learning algorithm with
the feature extraction model presented in [7], but it did not
perform comparable to PV or BoW. Therefore, we did not
present the results with PV-TM to keep the analysis simple
and sequential.
It has been shown in our results that both PV and BoW
work well for speciﬁc systematic reviews. It is not feasible to
estimate with certainty in advance which of the two would
work better for a review. Meanwhile, we obtained the recall
for both feature extraction methods after screening through
initial 10% of the data. We can see that comparison in
Table 2. We report the recall for the initial 10% of the data
and denote in bold the approach that scores higher in terms
of WSS@95 by the end of the process. We observe that the
approach that has higher recall on the initial 10% of the data
works well in terms of WSS@95 by the end of the screening
process. As a result, we infer that both approaches - IG-
BOW or IG-PV - should be used in the beginning and then
the one that performs better should be continued.
We should mention that we experimented with diﬀerent
ensembles of feature extraction models, but since the results
were not impressive compared to the individual models, we
omit the results.

4. DISCUSSION
We should mention at this point that we also experi-
mented with learning paragraph vectors using additional ex-
ternal data in the case of public health and animal studies.
We expected that additional documents might lead to im-
proved paragraph vectors. These external data consisted of
studies related to the review in question, but most of these
were not directly relevant to the review. To our surprise,
we did not see any improvement in the results upon using
such external data for learning paragraph vectors. On the
contrary, the performance decreased as we used more ex-
ternal data during the learning of paragraph vectors. We
should also mention that we conducted our experiments on
more than 30 reviews, and obtained results similar to those
presented in this paper.
We observed that active learning can be an eﬀective strat-
egy to semi-automate manual annotations and reduce the
workload. But, the current active learning approaches do
not accurately estimate the proportion of relevant studies
that have been annotated. In many cases, it is necessary to
extract 95% or more relevant studies in order to avoid bias
in the systematic review. If there was an eﬀective way to
estimate the recall of the active learner precisely then the
screening process could move towards complete automation.
In the future, we will work towards an accurate recall esti-
mation while using an eﬃcient active learning strategy.
5. CONCLUSION
We evaluated diﬀerent feature extraction models over a
comprehensive dataset of reviews from varied domains. We
observed that both BoW and PV can outperform other ap-
proaches over certain reviews and domains.
We recognized that a naive active learning algorithm suf-
fers from bias. It tries to select documents that are similar
to documents in the training data.
Initially, the training
data are small and this could lead to reduced performance.
We propose a novelty based active learning algorithm that
works on exploring diﬀerent topics during the initial phases
of the active learning process and then proceeds based on
relevance in the later phases. It leads to more exploration
of diﬀerent topics in the beginning and better performance
in terms of WSS@95 by the end. We evaluate our approach
against naive active learning algorithm, and observe that
the proposed algorithm works equal to, or better than, the
naive algorithm in all instances.
We also develop insights regarding the choice of feature
extraction methods for diﬀerent reviews. We observe based
on our experiments on a large number of reviews, that both
the feature extraction methods should be used during the
screening of initial 10% studies. Afterwards, the better per-
forming approach should be continued.
It leads to some
extra manual annotations in the beginning, but the overall
gain in terms of WSS@95 compensates for that disadvan-
tage.
