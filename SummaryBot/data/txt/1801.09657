Abstract— The need to predict or ﬁll-in missing data, often
referred to as matrix completion, is a common challenge in to-
day’s data-driven world. Previous strategies typically assume that
no structural difference between observed and missing entries
exists. Unfortunately, this assumption is woefully unrealistic in
many applications. For example, in the classic Netﬂix challenge,
in which one hopes to predict user-movie ratings for unseen
ﬁlms, the fact that the viewer has not watched a given movie
may indicate a lack of interest in that movie, thus suggesting
a lower rating than otherwise expected. We propose adjusting
the standard nuclear norm minimization strategy for matrix
completion to account for such structural differences between
observed and unobserved entries by regularizing the values of
the unobserved entries. We show that the proposed method
outperforms nuclear norm minimization in certain settings.
thus violating the assumption of uniform sampling of observed
entries across movies. On the ﬂip side, a missing entry may
indicate a user’s lack of interest in that particular movie.
Similarly, in sensor networks, entries may be missing because
of geographic limitations or missing connections; in survey
data, incomplete sections may be irrelevant or unimportant to
the user. In these settings, it is then reasonable to expect that
missing entries have lower values1 than observed entries.
In this work, we propose a modiﬁcation to the traditional
NNM for matrix completion that still results in a semi-deﬁnite
optimization problem, but also encourages lower values among
the unobserved entries. We show that this method works better
than NNM alone under certain sampling conditions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Data acquisition and analysis is ubiquitous, but data often
contains errors and can be highly incomplete. For example, if
data is obtained via user surveys, people may only choose to
answer a subset of questions. Ideally, one would not want to
eliminate surveys that are only partially complete, as they still
contain potentially useful information. For many tasks, such
as certain regression or classiﬁcation tasks, one may require
complete or completed data [SG02]. Alternatively, consider the
problem of collaborative ﬁltering, made popular by the classic
Netﬂix problem [BL07], [BK07], [KBV09], in which one aims
to predict user ratings for unseen movies based on available
user-movie ratings. In this setting, accurate data completion is
the goal, as opposed to a data pre-processing task. Viewing
users as the rows in a matrix and movies as the columns,
we would like to recover unknown entries of the resulting
matrix from the subset of known entries. This is the goal
in many types of other applications, ranging from systems
identiﬁcation [LV09] to sensor networks [BLWY06], [Sch86],
[Sin08]. This task is known as matrix completion [Rec11]. If
the underlying matrix is low-rank and the observed entries are
sampled uniformly at random, one can achieve exact recovery
with high probability under mild additional assumptions by
using nuclear norm minimization (NNM) [CT10], [RFP10],
[CR09], [Gro11], [CP10].
For many applications, however, we expect structural dif-
ferences between the observed and unobserved entries, which
violate these classical assumptions. By structural differences,
we mean that whether an entry is observed or unobserved need
not be random or occur by some uniform selection mechanism.
Consider again the Netﬂix problem. Popular, or well-received
movies are more likely to have been rated by many users,
A. Nuclear Norm Matrix Completion
Let M ∈ Rn1×n2 be the unknown matrix we would like to
recover and Ω be the set of indices of the observed entries.
Let PΩ : Rn1×n2 → Rn1×n2, where
(cid:40)
[PΩ]ij =
Mij
(i, j) ∈ Ω
(i, j) (cid:54)∈ Ω
as in [CT10]. In many applications, it is reasonable to assume
that the matrix M is low-rank. For example, we expect that
relatively few factors contribute to a user’s movie preferences
as compared to the number of users or number of movies con-
sidered. Similarly, for health data, a few underlying features
may contribute to many observable signs and symptoms.
The minimization,
(cid:99)M = argmin
rank(A) s.t. PΩ(A) = PΩ(M )
recovers the lowest rank matrix that matches the observed
entries exactly. Unfortunately, this minimization problem is
NP-hard, so one typically uses the convex relaxation
||A||∗ s.t. PΩ(A) = PΩ(M ),
(cid:99)M = argmin
singular values, i.e. ||X||∗ := (cid:80)
where || · ||∗ is the nuclear norm, given by the sum of the
i σi(X) [CT10], [RFP10],
(1)
[CP10], [CR09].
1Of course, some applications will tend to have higher values in missing
entries, in which case our methods can be scaled accordingly.
B. Matrix Completion for Structured Observations
We propose adding a regularization term on the unobserved
entries to promote adherence to the structural assumption that
we expect these entries to be close to 0. We solve
(cid:102)M = argmin
L1 norm ||M||1 =(cid:80)
||A||∗ + α||PΩC (A)|| s.t. PΩ(A) = PΩ(M ),
(2)
where α > 0 and || · || is an appropriate matrix norm. For
example, if we expect most of the unobserved entries to be 0,
but a few to be potentially large in magnitude, the entrywise
ij |Mij| is a reasonable choice.
C. Matrix Completion with Noisy Observations
In reality, we expect that our data is corrupted by some
amount of noise. We assume the matrix M, that we would
like to recover, satisﬁes
PΩY = PΩM + PΩZ,
where PΩY are the observed values, M is low-rank and PΩZ
represents the noise in the observed data. In [CP10], Cand´es
and Plan suggest using the following minimization to recover
the unknown matrix:
||A||∗ s. t. ||PΩ(M − A)||F < δ.
(3)
(cid:99)M = argmin
(cid:113)(cid:80)
alent to (cid:99)M = argmin
Recall, ||X||F =
ij X 2
ij. The formulation above is equiv-
||PΩ(M − A)||F + ρ||A||∗
(4)
for some ρ = ρ(δ). The latter minimization problem is
generally easier to solve in practice [CP10].
In order to account for the assumption that the unobserved
entries are likely to be close to zero, we again propose adding
a regularization term on the unobserved entries and aim to
solve(cid:102)M = argmin
||PΩ(M − A)||F + ρ||A||∗ + α||PΩC (A)||. (5)
II. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Recovery without Noise
We ﬁrst investigate the performance of (2) when the ob-
served entries are exact, i.e. there is no noise or errors in the
observed values. In Figure 1, we consider low-rank matrices
M ∈ R30×30. To generate M of rank r, we take M = MLMR,
where ML ∈ R30×r and MR ∈ Rr×30 are sparse matrices
(with density 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and whose nonzero
entries are uniformly distributed at random between zero and
one. We subsample from the zero and nonzero entries of
the data matrix at various rates to generate a matrix with
missing entries. We compare performance of (2) using L1
regularization on the unobserved entries with standard NNM
and report the error ratio ||(cid:102)M −M||F /||(cid:99)M −M||F for various
sampling rates, where (cid:102)M and (cid:99)M are the solutions to (2)
and (1), respectively. The regularization parameter α used
is selected optimally from the set {10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4}
(discussed below). Values below one in Figure 1 indicate that
the minimization with L1 regularization outperforms standard
NNM. Results are averaged over ten trials. As expected, we
ﬁnd that if the sampling of the nonzero entries is high, then the
modiﬁed method (2) is likely to outperform standard NNM.
We choose the parameter α, for the regularization term,
to be optimal among α ∈ {10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4} and
report the values used in Figure 2. For large α, the recovered
matrix will approach that for which all unobserved entries are
predicted to be zero, and as α becomes close to zero, recovery
by (2) approaches that of standard NNM.
When the sampling rate of the zero entries is low and the
sampling of the nonzero entries is high, in addition to (2)
outperforming NNM, we also see that a larger value for α
is optimal, supporting the claim that regularization improves
performance. Higher α values are also sometimes optimal
when the nonzero sampling rate is nearly zero. If there are
very few nonzero entries sampled then the low-rank matrix
recovered is likely to be very close to the zero matrix. In
this setting, we expect
that even with standard NNM the
unobserved entries are thus likely to be recovered as zeros
and so a larger coefﬁcient on the regularization term will not
harm performance. When α is close to zero, the difference in
performance is minimal, as the regularization will have little
effect in this case.

B. Recovery with Noisy Observed Entries
We generate matrices as in the previous section and now
consider the minimization given in (4). Suppose the entries of
the noise matrix Z are i.i.d. N (0, σ2). We set the parameter

C. Matrix recovery of health data
Next, we consider real survey data from 2126 patients
responding to 65 particular questions provided by LymeDis-
ease.org. Data used was obtained from the LymeDisease.org
patient registry, MyLymeData, Phase 1, June 17, 2017. Ques-
tion responses are integer values between zero and four and
answering all questions was required, that is this subset of the
data survey is complete (so we may calculate reconstruction
errors). All patients have Lyme disease and survey questions
ask about topics such as current and past symptoms, treatments
and outcomes. For example, “I would say that currently in
general my health is: 0-Poor, 1-Fair, 2-Good, 3-Very good,
4-Excellent.” Although, this part of the data considered is
complete, we expect that in general, patients are likely to
record responses for particularly noticeable symptoms, while
a missing response in a medical survey may indicate a lack
of symptoms. Thus, in this setting, L1 regularization of the
unobserved entries is a natural choice.
Due to computational constraints, for each of the ten trials
executed, we randomly sample 50 of these patient surveys to
generate a 50x65 matrix. As in the previous experiments, we
subsample from the zero and nonzero entries of the data matrix
at various rates to generate a matrix with missing entries. We
complete this subsampled matrix with both NNM (1) and (2)
using L1 regularization on the unobserved entries and report
||(cid:102)M −M||F /||(cid:99)M −M||F , averaged over ten trials in Figure 4.
The parameter α, for the regularization term, is chosen to be
optimal among α ∈ {10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4} and we report
the values used in Figure 5.
The results for the Lyme disease data match closely those
found in the synthetic experiments done with and without
noise. Regularizing the L1-norm of the unobserved entries
improves performance if the sampling of non-zero entries is
sufﬁciently high and sampling of zero entries is sufﬁciently
low.

for the minimization given in (2) with L1 regularization on the recovered
values for the unobserved entries. The matrices considered here are the same
as in Figure 1.
We speciﬁcally consider low-rank matrices M ∈ R30×30
generated as in the previous section and a noise matrix Z
with i.i.d. entries sampled from N (0, 0.01). Thus we set
ρ = 2

Figure 3. Here,(cid:99)M and(cid:102)M are given by (4) and (5) respectively.
We see improved performance with regularization when the
sampling rate of the zero entries is low and the sampling of
the nonzero entries is high.

A. Connection to Robust Principal Component Analysis
(RPCA)
The program (2) very closely resembles the method pro-
posed in [CLMW11], called Robust Principal Component
Analysis (RPCA). RPCA is a modiﬁed version of traditional
Principal Component Analysis that is robust to rare corruptions
of arbitrary magnitude. In RPCA, one assumes that a low-
rank matrix has some set of its entries corrupted. The goal is
to recover the true underlying matrix despite the corruptions.
More simply, for the observed matrix Y ∈ Rn1×n2, we have
the decomposition
Y = L + S,
where L is the low-rank matrix we would like to recover and
S is a sparse matrix of corruptions. The strategy for ﬁnding
this decomposition proposed in [CLMW11] is
||L||∗ + α||S||1 s.t. L + S = Y.
(6)
argmin
L,S
This method can be extended to the matrix completion setting,
in which one would like to recover unobserved values from
observed values, of which a subset may be corrupted. In this
setting, [CLMW11] proposes solving the following minimiza-
tion problem
||L||∗ + α||S||1 s.t. PΩ(L + S) = PΩ(Y ).
argmin
L,S
We now return to our original matrix completion problem,
in which we assume the observed entries to be exact. Let
M ∈ Rn1×n2 again be the matrix we aim to recover. If we
expect the unobserved entries of M to be sparse, that is, only
a small fraction of them to be nonzero, we can rewrite the
minimization (2) in a form similar to RPCA in which we know
the support of the corruptions is restricted to the set ΩC, i.e.
S = PΩC (S). We then have,
||A||∗ + α||S||1 s.t. A + S = PΩ(M ).

This strategy differs from traditional RPCA in that we assume
the observed data to be free from errors and therefore know
that the corruptions are restricted to the set of unobserved
entries.

Directly applying Theorem 1.1 from [CLMW11], we have

unobserved entries is uniformly distributed among all sets
of cardinality s contained in ΩC. Then there is a numerical

values for the unobserved entries in Lyme patient data.
III. ANALYTICAL REMARKS
We provide here some basic analysis of the regularization
approach. First, in the simpliﬁed setting, in which all of the
unobserved entries are exactly zero, the modiﬁed recovery
given in (2) will always perform at least as well as traditional
NNM.
Proposition 1: Suppose M ∈ Rn1×n2 and Ω gives the set
of index pairs of the observed entries. Assume that all of the
unobserved entries are exactly zero, i.e. PΩC (M ) = 0. Then
for
(cid:99)M = argmin||A||∗ s.t. PΩ(A) = PΩ(M ),
and(cid:102)M = argmin||A||∗ + α||PΩC (A)|| s.t. PΩ(A) = PΩ(M ),
we have
for any matrix norm || · ||.
Proof: From the deﬁnitions of (cid:99)M and (cid:102)M,
||(cid:102)M − M|| ≤ ||(cid:99)M − M||
||(cid:99)M||∗ ≤ ||(cid:102)M||∗.
For α > 0, we have
Using the inequality above,
||(cid:102)M||∗ + α||PΩC ((cid:102)M )|| ≤ ||(cid:99)M||∗ + α||PΩC ((cid:99)M )||
≤ ||(cid:102)M||∗ + α||PΩC ((cid:99)M )||.
||PΩC ((cid:102)M )|| ≤ ||PΩC ((cid:99)M )||.
PΩ((cid:102)M ) = PΩ((cid:99)M ) = PΩ(M )
and under the assumption that PΩC (M ) = 0, as
||(cid:102)M − M|| = ||PΩC ((cid:102)M )|| ≤ ||PΩC ((cid:99)M )|| = ||(cid:99)M − M||.
The desired result then follows since

minimization in (7) with α = 1/
n achieves exact recovery,
provided that
rank(L0) ≤ ρrn(2)µ−1(log n(1))−2 and s ≤ ρsn(1)n(2),
where ρr and ρs are positive numerical constants.
This proposition is a direct application of Theorem 1.1
in [CLMW11] to the program given by (7). Note that here,
the corruptions are exactly the unobserved entries that are
nonzero. Thus, if s, the number of nonzero unobserved entries
is small, this result may be stronger than corresponding matrix
completion results that

instead depend on m,
The authors of [CLMW11] note that RPCA can be thought
of as a more challenging version of matrix completion. The
reasoning being, that in matrix completion we aim to recover
the set of unobserved entries, whose locations are known,
whereas in the RPCA setting, we have a set of corrupted
entries, whose locations are unknown, and for which we would
like to both identify as erroneous and determine their correct
values. Figure 1 of [CLMW11] provides numerical evidence
that in practice RPCA does in fact require more stringent
conditions to achieve exact recovery than the corresponding
matrix completion problem. In image completion or repair,
corruptions are often spatially correlated or isolated to speciﬁc
regions of an image. In [LRZM12], the authors provide exper-
imental evidence that incorporating an estimate of the support
of the corruptions aids in recovery. By the same reasoning,
we expect that a stronger result than suggested by Proposition
2 likely holds, as we do not make use of the fact that we
are able to restrict the locations of the corruptions (nonzero,
unobserved entries) to a subset of the larger matrix.
IV. DISCUSSION
For incomplete data in which we expect that unobserved
entries are likely to be 0, we ﬁnd that regularizing the values
of the unobserved entries when performing NNM improves
performance under various conditions. This improvement in
performance holds for both synthetic data, with and without
noise, as well as for Lyme disease survey data. We speciﬁcally
investigate the performance of L1 regularization on the unob-
served entries as it is a natural choice for many applications.
Testing the validity of methods, such as (2), on real data
is challenging, since this setting hinges on the assumption
that unobserved data is structurally different than observed
data and would require having access to ground truth values
for the unobserved entries. In this paper, we choose to take
complete data and artiﬁcially partition it into observed and
unobserved entries. Another way to manage this challenge is
to examine performance of various tasks, such as classiﬁcation
or prediction, based on data that has been completed in
different ways. In this setting, relative performance of different
completion strategies will likely depend on the speciﬁc task
considered. However, for many applications, one would like
to complete the data in order to use it for a further goal. In
this setting, judging the performance of the matrix completion
algorithm by its effect on performance of the ultimate goal is
very natural.
We offer preliminary arguments as to why we might ex-
pect the approach in (2) to work well under the structural
assumption that unobserved entries are likely to be sparse
or small in magnitude, however, stronger theoretical results
are likely possible. For example, we show that regularizing
the values of the unobserved entries when performing NNM
improves performance in the case when all unobserved entries
are exactly zero, but based on empirical evidence we expect
improved performance under more general conditions.
A range of papers, including [CT10], [RFP10], [CR09],
[Gro11], discuss the conditions under which exact matrix
completion is possible under the assumption that the observed
entries of the matrix are sampled uniformly at random. Under
what reasonable structural assumptions on the unobserved
entries might we still be able to specify conditions that will
lead to exact recovery? We save such questions for future
work.
