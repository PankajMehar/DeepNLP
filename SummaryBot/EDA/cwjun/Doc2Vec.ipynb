       "' This paper deals with the reality gap from a novel perspective, targeting transferring Deep Reinforce- ment Learning (DRL) policies learned in simulated environments to the real-world domain for visual control tasks. Instead of adopting the common so- lutions to the problem by increasing the visual \\xef\\xac\\x81- delity of synthetic images output from simulators during the training phase, this paper seeks to tackle the problem by translating the real-world image streams back to the synthetic domain during the de- ployment phase, to make the robot feel at home. We propose this as a lightweight, \\xef\\xac\\x82exible, and ef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient solution for visual control, as 1) no extra trans- fer steps are required during the expensive training of DRL agents in simulation; 2) the trained DRL agents will not be constrained to being deployable in only one speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c real-world environment; 3) the policy training and the transfer operations are de- coupled, and can be conducted in parallel. Besides this, we propose a conceptually simple yet very ef- fective shift loss to constrain the consistency be- tween subsequent frames, eliminating the need for optical \\xef\\xac\\x82ow. We validate the shift loss for artis- tic style transfer for videos and domain adaptation, and validate our visual control approach in real- world robot experiments.
