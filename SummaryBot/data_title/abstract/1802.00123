Sigma-Pi-Sigma neural networks (SPSNNs) as a kind of high-order neural networks can provide more
powerful mapping capability than the traditional feedforward neural networks (Sigma-Sigma neural
networks). In the existing literature, in order to reduce the number of the Pi nodes in the Pi layer,
a special multinomial Ps is used in SPSNNs. Each monomial in Ps is linear with respect to each
particular variable σi when the other variables are taken as constants. Therefore, the monomials like
σn
i or σn
i σj with n > 1 are not included. This choice may be somehow intuitive, but is not necessarily
the best. We propose in this paper a modiﬁed Sigma-Pi-Sigma neural network (MSPSNN) with an
adaptive approach to ﬁnd a better multinomial for a given problem. To elaborate, we start from a
complete multinomial with a given order. Then we employ a regularization technique in the learning
process for the given problem to reduce the number of monomials used in the multinomial, and end
up with a new SPSNN involving the same number of monomials (= the number of nodes in the
Pi-layer) as in Ps. Numerical experiments on some benchmark problems show that our MSPSNN
behaves better than the traditional SPSNN with Ps.
