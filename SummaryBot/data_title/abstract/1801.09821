Projective cone scheduling deﬁnes a large class of rate-stabilizing policies for queueing models relevant to several
applications. While there exists considerable theory on the properties of projective cone schedulers, there is little
practical guidance on choosing the parameters that deﬁne them. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for designing an
automated projective cone scheduling system based on observations of an expert projective cone scheduler. We show that
the estimated scheduling policy is able to emulate the expert in the sense that the average loss realized by the learned
policy will converge to zero. Speciﬁcally, for a system with n queues observed over a time horizon T , the average loss for
. This upper bound holds regardless of the statistical characteristics of the system.
the algorithm is O
The algorithm uses the multiplicative weights update method and can be applied online so that additional observations
of the expert scheduler can be used to improve an existing estimate of the policy. This provides a data-driven method
for designing a scheduling policy based on observations of a human expert. We demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the algorithm
with a simple numerical example and discuss several extensions.
