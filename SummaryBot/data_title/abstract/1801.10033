 
The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation 
(AF), which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat [1].  
Objectives: Atrial fibrillation  (AF) is a common heart 
rhythm  disorder  associated  with  deadly  and  debilitating 
consequences including heart failure, stroke, poor mental 
health,  reduced  quality  of  life  and  death.  Having  an 
automatic system that diagnoses various types of cardiac 
arrhythmias  would  assist  cardiologists 
initiate 
appropriate  preventive  measures  and  to  improve  the 
analysis  of  cardiac  disease.  To  this  end,  this  paper 
introduces  a  new  approach  to  detect  and  classify 
automatically cardiac arrhythmias in electrocardiograms 
(ECG) recordings. 
to 
Methods: The proposed approach used a combination 
of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and a sequence 
of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, with pooling, 
dropout  and  normalization  techniques  to  improve  their 
accuracy. The network predicted a classification at every 
18th input sample and we selected the final prediction for 
classification.  Results  were  cross-validated  on 
the 
Physionet  Challenge  2017 
training  dataset,  which 
contains  8,528  single  lead  ECG  recordings  lasting  from 
9s to just over 60s. 
Results:  Using  the  proposed  structure  and  no  explicit 
feature  selection,  10-fold  stratified  cross-validation  gave 
an  overall  F-measure  of  0.83.10±0.015  on  the  held-out 
test  data  (mean  ±  standard  deviation  over  all  folds)  and 
0.80 on the hidden dataset of the Challenge entry server.
