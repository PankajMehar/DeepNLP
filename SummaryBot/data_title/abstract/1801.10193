The identification of novel drug-target (DT) interactions is a substantial part
of the drug discovery process. Most of the computational methods that have
been proposed to predict DT interactions have focused on binary classification,
where the goal is to determine whether a DT pair interacts or not. However,
protein-ligand interactions assume a continuum of binding strength values, also
called binding affinity and predicting this value still remains a challenge. The
increase in the affinity data available in DT knowledge-bases allow the use of
advanced learning techniques such as deep learning architectures in the predic-
tion of binding affinities. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based model
that uses only sequence information of both targets and drugs to predict DT
interaction binding affinities. The few studies that focus on DT binding affinity
prediction either use 3D structure of protein-ligand complexes or 2D features of
compounds. One novel approach used in this work is the modeling of protein
sequences and compound 1D representations with convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The results show that the proposed deep learning based model that uses
the 1D representations of targets and drugs is an effective approach for drug tar-
get binding affinity prediction. The model in which a high-level representation
of a drug is constructed via CNNs and Smith-Waterman similarity is used for
proteins achieved the best Concordance Index (CI) performance, outperforming
KronRLS, a state-of-the-art algorithm for DT binding affinity prediction, with
statistical significance.
