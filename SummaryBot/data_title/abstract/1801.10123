We present a novel algorithm, called Links, designed to perform
online clustering on unit vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean
space. The algorithm is appropriate when it is necessary to clus-
ter data efﬁciently as it streams in, and is to be contrasted with tra-
ditional batch clustering algorithms that have access to all data at
once. For example, Links has been successfully applied to embed-
ding vectors generated from face images or voice recordings for the
purpose of recognizing people, thereby providing real-time identiﬁ-
cation during video or audio capture.
