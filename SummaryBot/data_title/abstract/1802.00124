Model pruning has become a useful technique that improves the computational
efﬁciency of deep learning, making it possible to deploy solutions on resource-
limited scenarios. A widely-used practice in relevant work assumes that a smaller-
norm parameter or feature plays a less informative role at the inference time. In
this paper, we propose a channel pruning technique for accelerating the compu-
tations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which does not critically
rely on this assumption. Instead, it focuses on direct simpliﬁcation of the channel-
to-channel computation graph of a CNN without the need of performing a compu-
tational difﬁcult and not always useful task of making high-dimensional tensors of
CNN structured sparse. Our approach takes two stages: the ﬁrst being to adopt an
end-to-end stochastic training method that eventually forces the outputs of some
channels being constant, and the second being to prune those constant channels
from the original neural network by adjusting the biases of their impacting layers
such that the resulting compact model can be quickly ﬁne-tuned. Our approach
is mathematically appealing from an optimization perspective and easy to repro-
duce. We experimented our approach through several image learning benchmarks
and demonstrate its interesting aspects and the competitive performance.
