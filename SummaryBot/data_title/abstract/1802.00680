. Recent advances in analysis of subband amplitude envelopes
of natural sounds have resulted in convincing synthesis, showing subband
amplitudes to be a crucial component of perception. Probabilistic latent
variable analysis is particularly revealing, but existing approaches donâ€™t
incorporate prior knowledge about the physical behaviour of amplitude
envelopes, such as exponential decay and feedback. We use latent force
modelling, a probabilistic learning paradigm that incorporates physical
knowledge into Gaussian process regression, to model correlation across
spectral subband envelopes. We augment the standard latent force model
approach by explicitly modelling correlations over multiple time steps.
Incorporating this prior knowledge strengthens the interpretation of the
latent functions as the source that generated the signal. We examine this
interpretation via an experiment which shows that sounds generated by
sampling from our probabilistic model are perceived to be more realistic
than those generated by similar models based on nonnegative matrix
factorisation, even in cases where our model is outperformed from a
reconstruction error perspective.
