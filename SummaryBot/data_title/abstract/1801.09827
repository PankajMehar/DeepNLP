 It is well-known that the robustness of artiﬁcial
neural networks (ANNs) is important for their wide ranges
of applications. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of
the classiﬁcation ability of a spiking neural network which
receives perturbed inputs. Actually, the perturbation is al-
lowed to be arbitrary styles. However, Gaussian perturba-
tion and other regular ones have been rarely investigated.
For classiﬁcation problems, the closer to the desired point,
the more perturbed points there are in the input space. In
addition, the perturbation may be periodic. Based on these
facts, we only consider sinusoidal and Gaussian perturba-
tions in this paper. With the SpikeProp algorithm, we per-
form extensive experiments on the classical XOR problem
and other three benchmark datasets. The numerical results
show that there is not signiﬁcant reduction in the classiﬁca-
tion ability of the network if the input signals are subject to
sinusoidal and Gaussian perturbations.
