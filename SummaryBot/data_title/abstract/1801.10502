. For 50 years, research in the area of inductive inference aims
at investigating the learning of formal languages and is inﬂuenced by
computability theory, complexity theory, cognitive science, machine learn-
ing, and more generally artiﬁcial intelligence. Being one of the pioneers,
Gold [1967] investigated the most common formalization, learning in the
limit both from solely positive examples as well as from positive and
negative information. The ﬁrst mode of presentation has been studied
extensively, including insights in how diﬀerent additional requirements
on the hypothesis sequence of the learner or requested properties of the
latter itself, restrict what collections of languages are learnable.
We focus on the second paradigm, learning from informants, and study
how imposing diﬀerent restrictions on the learning process eﬀects learn-
ability. For example, we show that learners can be assumed to only
change their hypothesis in case it is inconsistent with the data (such
learners are called conservative). Further, we give a picture of how the
most important learning restrictions relate. Our investigations underpin
the claim for delayability being the right structural property to gain a
deeper understanding concerning the nature of learning restrictions.
