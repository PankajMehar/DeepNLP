Relational data sources are still one of the most popular ways to store enterprise or Web data,
however, the issue with relational schema is the lack of a well-deﬁned semantic description.
A common ontology provides a way to represent the meaning of a relational schema and can
facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data sources within a domain. Semantic labeling is
achieved by mapping attributes from the data sources to the classes and properties in the ontology.
We formulate this problem as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem where previously labeled data
sources are used to learn rules for labeling new data sources. The majority of existing approaches
for semantic labeling have focused on data integration challenges such as naming conﬂicts and
semantic heterogeneity. In addition, machine learning approaches typically have issues around
class imbalance, lack of labeled instances and relative importance of attributes. To address
these issues, we develop a new machine learning model with engineered features as well as two
deep learning models which do not require extensive feature engineering. We evaluate our new
approaches with the state-of-the-art.
