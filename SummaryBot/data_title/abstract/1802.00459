Sensitivity based sampling is crucial for constructing nearly-optimal coreset for k-means /
median clustering.
In this paper, we provide a novel data structure that enables sensitivity
sampling over a dynamic data stream, where points from a high dimensional discrete Euclidean
space can be either inserted or deleted. Based on this data structure, we provide a one-pass
coreset construction for k-means clustering using space (cid:101)O(k poly(d)) over d-dimensional geo-
metric dynamic data streams. While previous best known result is only for k-median[BFL+17],
which cannot be directly generalized to k-means to obtain algorithms with space nearly linear
in k. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the ﬁrst dynamic geometric data stream
algorithm for k-means using space polynomial in dimension and nearly optimal in k.
We further show that our data structure for maintaining coreset can be extended as a uniﬁed
approach for a more general classes of k-clustering, including k-median, M-estimator clustering,
and clusterings with a more general set of cost functions over distances. For all these tasks, the
space/time of our algorithm is similar to k-means with only poly(d) factor diﬀerence.
