 
The  development  of  accurate  and  transferable  machine learning  (ML)  potentials  for predicting 
molecular  energetics  is  a  challenging  task.  The  process  of  data  generation  to  train  such  ML 
potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully 
automated  approach  for  the  generation  of  datasets  with  the  intent  of  training  universal  ML 
potentials.  It  is based on the concept  of active learning  (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), 
which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the 
ensembleâ€™s prediction. QBC allows our AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical 
space  where  the  machine  learned  potential  fails  to  accurately  predict  the  potential  energy.  AL 
improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases 
by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use.  AL also reduces the training 
set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide 
validation of our AL approach we develop the COMP6 benchmark (publicly available on GitHub), 
which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. We show the use of our proposed AL technique 
develops  a  universal  ANI  potential  (ANI-1x),  which  provides  very  accurate  energy  and  force 
predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal potential achieves a level of accuracy 
on par with the best ML potentials for single molecule or materials, while remaining applicable to 
the general class of organic molecules comprised of the elements CHNO.
