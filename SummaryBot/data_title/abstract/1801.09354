 We propose two general and falsiﬁable hypotheses about expecta-
tions on generalization error when learning in the context of concept drift. One
posits that as drift rate increases, the forgetting rate that minimizes generaliza-
tion error will also increase and vice versa. The other posits that as a learner’s
forgetting rate increases, the bias/variance proﬁle that minimizes generaliza-
tion error will have lower variance and vice versa. These hypotheses lead to
the concept of the sweet path, a path through the 3-d space of alternative drift
rates, forgetting rates and bias/variance proﬁles on which generalization er-
ror will be minimized, such that slow drift is coupled with low forgetting and
low bias, while rapid drift is coupled with fast forgetting and low variance.
We present experiments that support the existence of such a sweet path. We
also demonstrate that simple learners that select appropriate forgetting rates
and bias/variance proﬁles are highly competitive with the state-of-the-art in
incremental learners for concept drift on real-world drift problems.
