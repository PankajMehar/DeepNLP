Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for
learning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of
recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images.
Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars,
molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A
naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical
signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such
a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective.
In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs.
We propose a deﬁnition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expres-
sive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisﬁes a generalized
Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efﬁciently using a generalized
(non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the
computational efﬁciency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs
applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression.
