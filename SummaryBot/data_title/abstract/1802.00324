.  Intrusion  detection for computer network systems has  been 
becoming  one of the most critical tasks for network administrators today. 
It  has an important role for organizations, governments and our society 
due to the valuable resources hosted on computer networks. Traditional 
misuse detection strategies are unable to detect new and unknown intru- 
sion  types.  In  contrast,  anomaly detection in  network security  aims  to 
distinguish  between illegal  or  malicious events and  normal behavior of 
network systems. Anomaly detection can be considered as a classification 
problem where  it  builds  models of normal network behavior, of which it 
uses  to  detect  new patterns  that  significantly deviate  from the  model. 
Most  of the  current  approaches on  anomaly  detection is  based  on the 
learning of normal behavior and anomalous actions. They  do not include 
memory that is they do not take into account previous events classify new 
ones. In  this  paper, we propose a one-class collective anomaly detection 
model based  on  neural  network learning.  Normally a  Long  Short-Term 
Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM  RNN) is trained only on nor- 
mal  data,  and  it  is  capable of predicting several time-steps ahead of an 
input.  In  our approach, a  LSTM  RNN  is  trained on normal time series 
data  before performing a  prediction for each time-step. Instead  of con- 
sidering  each  time-step separately,  the  observation of prediction  errors 
from a  certain number of time-steps is  now proposed as  a  new idea  for 
detecting collective anomalies. The  prediction  errors of a  certain  num- 
ber  of the latest time-steps above a  threshold will  indicate  a  collective 
anomaly. The  model is  evaluated on a  time series version of the KDD 
1999 dataset. The  experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is 
capable to detect collective anomaly efficiently.
