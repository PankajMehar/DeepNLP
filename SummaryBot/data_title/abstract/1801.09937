—We present a fast Compressive Sensing algorithm for
the reconstruction of binary signals {0, 1}-valued binary signals
from its linear measurements. The proposed algorithm minimizes
a non-convex penalty function that is given by a weighted sum
of smoothed ℓ0 norms, under the [0, 1] box-constraint.
It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm is not
only signiﬁcantly faster than linear-programming-based convex
optimization algorithms, but also shows a better recovery per-
formance under several different metrics.
