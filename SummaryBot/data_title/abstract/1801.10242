We consider high dimensional dynamic multi-product pricing with an evolving
but low-dimensional linear demand model. Assuming the temporal variation in
cross-elasticities exhibits low-rank structure based on ﬁxed (latent) features of the
products, we show that the revenue maximization problem reduces to an online
bandit convex optimization with side information given by the observed demands.
We design dynamic pricing algorithms whose revenue approaches that of the best
ﬁxed price vector in hindsight, at a rate that only depends on the intrinsic rank of
the demand model and not the number of products. Our approach applies a bandit
convex optimization algorithm in a projected low-dimensional space spanned by the
latent product features, while simultaneously learning this span via online singular
value decomposition of a carefully-crafted matrix containing the observed demands.
