Incremental versions of batch algorithms are
often desired, for increased time efﬁciency
in the streaming data setting, or increased
memory efﬁciency in general.
In this paper
we present a novel algorithm for incremen-
tal kernel PCA, based on rank one updates to
the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix,
which is more computationally efﬁcient than
comparable existing algorithms. We extend
our algorithm to incremental calculation of the
Nystr¨om approximation to the kernel matrix,
the ﬁrst such algorithm proposed. Incremen-
tal calculation of the Nystr¨om approximation
leads to further gains in memory efﬁciency,
and allows for empirical evaluation of when a
subset of sufﬁcient size has been obtained.
