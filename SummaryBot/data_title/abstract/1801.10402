—We study the problem of learning to rank from multiple
sources. Though multi-view learning and learning to rank have been
studied extensively leading to a wide range of applications, multi-view
learning to rank as a synergy of both topics has received little attention.
The aim of the paper is to propose a composite ranking method while
keeping a close correlation with the individual rankings simultaneously.
We propose a multi-objective solution to ranking by capturing the infor-
mation of the feature mapping from both within each view as well as
across views using autoencoder-like networks. Moreover, a novel end-
to-end solution is introduced to enhance the joint ranking with minimum
view-speciﬁc ranking loss, so that we can achieve the maximum global
view agreements within a single optimization process. The proposed
method is validated on a wide variety of ranking problems, including uni-
versity ranking, multi-view lingual text ranking and image data ranking,
providing superior results.
