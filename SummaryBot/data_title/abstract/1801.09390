—In this era of data deluge, many signal processing
and machine learning tasks are faced with high-dimensional
datasets, including images, videos, as well as time series gen-
erated from social, commercial and brain network interactions.
Their efﬁcient processing calls for dimensionality reduction
techniques capable of properly compressing the data while
preserving task-related characteristics, going beyond pairwise
data correlations. The present paper puts forth a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction framework that accounts for data lying
on known graphs. The novel framework turns out to encompass
most of the existing dimensionality reduction methods as special
cases, and it is capable of capturing and preserving possibly
nonlinear correlations that are ignored by linear methods, as
well as taking into account information from multiple graphs. An
efﬁcient algorithm admitting closed-form solution is developed
and tested on synthetic datasets to corroborate its effectiveness.
