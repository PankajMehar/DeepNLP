Tactical driving decision making is crucial for au-
tonomous driving systems and has attracted con-
siderable interest in recent years.
In this paper,
we propose several practical components that can
speed up deep reinforcement learning algorithms
towards tactical decision making tasks: 1) non-
uniform action skipping as a more stable alternative
to action-repetition frame skipping, 2) a counter-
based penalty for lanes on which ego vehicle has
less right-of-road, and 3) heuristic inference-time
action masking for apparently undesirable actions.
We evaluate the proposed components in a realistic
driving simulator and compare them with several
baselines. Results show that the proposed scheme
provides superior performance in terms of safety,
efÔ¨Åciency, and comfort.
